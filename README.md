# Mango Leaf Disease Classification

This repository contains a Notebook for classifying mango leaf diseases using neural network. The goal of the project is to accurately identify and classify various diseases affecting mango leaves to aid in their early detection and treatment.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of mango leaf diseases using images. It involves data preprocessing, and the application of transfer learning models InceptionV3 to classify the images into different disease categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of mango leaves, each labeled with the type of disease it contains. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/mango-leaf-disease-dataset).

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
